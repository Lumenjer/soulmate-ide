## A desktop IDE for Soulmate.

Soulmate IDE is an Electron app for writing LED patterns using the Soulmate firmware. All compilation is handled on the server, and previews use the Wokwi Arduino emulator.

This IDE was closed-source while I was still working on it. I've taken a break from active development, but any feature requests or pull requests are appreciated!
